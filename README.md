# Recommender-System-Based-on-processMining
This project was done as part of a master thesis in collaboration with Microsoft.

The system takes the train and test event logs created from the data file and creates the process models out of the train event logs using process discovery methods and then calculates the conformance checking fitness value between the test event logs and the process models. The maximum fitness values then can be used for the recommendation of the best models for the test event logs.

You can also find the data from https://github.com/microsoft/50BusinessAssignmentsLog. The file is also available in Data folder and I also added the connector labels to that.
