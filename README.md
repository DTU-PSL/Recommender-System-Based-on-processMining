# Recommender-System-Based-on-processMining
This project done as part of a master thesis. The system takes the train and test event logs and create the process models out of the train event logs using process discovery methods and then calculates the conformance checking fitness value between the test event logs and the process models. The maximum fitness values then can be used for the recommendation of the best models for the test event logs.
